# [Project name]
"The Road to Coexistence"
# Theme  

We explore the relationship between humans and machines through interactive story experiences. I mainly want to criticize and explore the system of this society through the topics of artificial intelligence and human beings. Inspiration comes from contemporary technological progress and possible future human-computer interaction scenarios, such as "Black Mirror" and other works.
# Mechanics  

Users will engage in an interactive story centered around decision-making. At critical moments, users are required to make choices that will shape the storyline and final outcome. In this way, users can experience the relationship between artificial intelligence and human decision-making.
# Aims  

Our goal is to guide users to think about the various aspects of integrating artificial intelligence into society and the impact this has on individuals and society. Through plot guidance, users can be inspired to think about technological ethics and social responsibility.
# Aesthetics

The project will feature a futuristic and technological aesthetic. The interface design will integrate mechanical elements and modern technology, presenting a layered and fascinating visual effect. Images and storyline will work together to create a thought-provoking atmosphere.
# Technology 

We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive stories. This technical implementation will provide users with an intuitive and engaging experience, allowing them to better integrate into the story situation.
